				<h2>About Impero Media</h2>
				
				<p>Impero Media is a full-service website solutions company, focusing on website design and development, as well as optimizing and consulting with existing sites. While websites themselves are the bread and butter of the company, a large amount of client work has also been spent integrating social media strategies and search engine optimization goals as part of a greater website and marketing strategy.</p>

				<p>At the end of the day, there is no aspect of providing website solutions that are out of our comfort zone. The site you want and the site you envision – both aesthetically and functionally – is what we are aiming to bring you.</p>

				<h2>About Luke</h2>

				<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/lukekohler/"><img class="img-border alignright size-medium wp-image-1243" alt="2" style="margin-right: 25px;" src="http://imperomedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2-275x300.jpg" width="205" height="225" /></a><p>I am Luke Kohler, and I own and operate Impero Media LLC out of Las Vegas, NV. I have spent the better part of my professional career working in web design, development and consulting. As the owner of a small business, I treat all of my clients as if they are my only client and give everyone the time, attention and dedication to finishing their project that they deserve. I continue to be in touch with nearly every client I’ve ever worked with, providing support and advice when necessary and maintaining casual friendships I’ve created along the way as well. Impero Media was created in 2012 when working directly with clients and helping them turn their visions into reality became a passion that needed a chance to be full-time.</p>

				<p>From a technical standpoint, I have expertise in HTML, CSS, Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, etc.), WordPress, MySQL, typography and many other coding and design skills. I am constantly learning new things and have a passion for staying on top of current events and trends in the industry. I also have worked with clients extensively on optimization and troubleshooting to fine-tune their websites into being the best possible sites.</p>
